Recursion in session types is almost always interpreted as
equirecursion. For example, the two session types $\TRec{\TOut \TInt X} $
and $\TRec{\TOut \TInt {\TOut \TInt X}} $ are considered equal because
their unfoldings as infinite trees are equal. That means, servers with
these types are interchangeable without breaking the protocol and
functions that expect arguments of one type also accept arguments of
the other type.

Using an isorecursive interpretation the two types are not equal
because unrolling of the recursion is a distinct communication
step. While channels of these two types are no longer
interchangeable, we can nevertheless define a pair of conversion
functions
$f : \TFun{\TRec{\TOut \TInt X}}{\TRec{\TOut \TInt {\TOut \TInt X}}}$
and
$f' : \TFun{\TRec{\TOut \TInt {\TOut \TInt X}}}{\TRec{\TOut \TInt X}}$
that mediate between the two types. Concretely:
\begin{align*}
  f &=       \ELam {c_1} \EFork{ \ELam {c_2} \ERec g %{
      \begin{array}[t]{l}
      \ELam{(c_1, c_2)} \\
      \ELet{(x_2,c_2)}{\ERecv{(\EUnroll{c_2})}} \\
      \ELet{c_1}{\ESend{x_2}{(\EUnroll{c_1})}} \\
      \ELet{(x_2,c_2)}{\ERecv{({c_2})}} \\
      \ELet{c_1}{\ESend{x_2}{(\EUnroll{c_1})}} \\
        g \; ({c_1}, {c_2}) %}
      \end{array}}
\end{align*}
As the session types are recursive, so are the conversion
functions. This conversion function creates one additional
channels and forks one additional process. Moreover, it leads to
additional communication as evidenced by the folklore rule for
isorecursive processes:
\begin{gather*}
  \reducerule{
    \PScope (\PPar* {\EUnroll a} {\EUnroll b})
  }{
    \PScope (\PPar* a b)
  }
\end{gather*}
However, if the underlying recursive session type is contractive, then we can
elide this extra communication, a move which essentially reinterprets
isorecursion as equirecursion.
This move makes a type conversion like $f$ act like an identity
function, which forwards messages from one channel to another, as the
$\EUnroll\_$ operations are just identities. 


Clearly, this transformation goes both ways. If we start from an
equirecursive program, we can transform it into an isorecursive one by
making the type conversion explicit. We can execute the isorecursive
program either with its ``natural'' semantics or with the silent
semantics that treats $\EUnroll\_$ as an identity.
The latter interpretation also makes the equirecursive version
``wire-compatible'' with the isorecursive one.\footnote{As we have
  mostly conjectures to offer on the operational side, the reviewers
  may consider downgrading this submission to a talk proposal.}
