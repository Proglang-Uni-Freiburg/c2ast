\label{sec:conclusion}

This work started from the question how to embed regular equirecursive
session types into algebraic session types
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-03764}. As a first step we
considered the translation of equirecursive sessions into isorecursive
ones and noticed that they were neglected by the literature (talking
bananas being an exception \cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/LindleyM16}). One
reason for the neglegience is the folklore statement ``The
equirecursive interpretation of a session type guarantees that no 
message is required for the unfolding of a recursive type.''
\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/BalzerP17}. We believe we dispelled this
myth by showing that isorecursive session types do not need messages
for unfolding as long as they are contractive.

In future work we will consider composing the results of this work
with a translation from isorecursive session types to algebraic
session types. There may also be scope to resolve subtyping by generating a conversion term
(different to Horne and Padovani's investigation
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-06398}, which is based on fixed point logic) to isorecursion. 

% \begin{itemize}
% \item define mapping isorecursive $\leftrightarrow$ algebraic session types
% \item silent transitions for algebraic session types
% \item composition yields wire compatibility between equirecursive + subtyping and algebraic session types
% \end{itemize}
