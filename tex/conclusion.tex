Future work
\begin{itemize}
\item subtyping can also be resolved by generating a conversion term (related to Horne, Padovani) into isorecursion
\item define mapping isorecursive $\leftrightarrow$ algebraic session types
\item silent transitions for algebraic session types
\item composition yields wire compatibility between equirecursive + subtyping and algebraic session types
\end{itemize}
